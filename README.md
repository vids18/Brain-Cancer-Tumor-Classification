# Background Story

Attending conferences like Grace Hopper, DataScience Go, ODSC West, and meeting people worldwide, I realized the importance of upskilling and learning daily. So after completing my masterâ€™s final Capstone project, I decided to take up this online course, Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-on Python & R In Data Science by Hadelin de Pontevas, Kirill Ermenko, to understand the basics and the intuitions behind the algorithms. This course had unique bonus videos covering topics such as Natural Language Processing, Artificial Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network, to name a few.


There were hands-on exercises during each module that helped with coding and giving outputs to these algorithms. Having an inquisitive mind, I wanted to check if a dataset could implement all the algorithms in one place. Here is the Brain Cancer Tumor dataset with five different algorithms implemented and compared to find the best one. I have also created a dashboard in Tableau that enhances the crucial factors required for classifying the tumor to be benign or malignant. 

# Attachments

All the Python files, tableau workbook, and the dataset has been attached in this repository. Also I have published my Tableau Visualization on #TableauPublic, you can find it here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/vidhi.rajesh.chitalia#!/vizhome/BrainCancerTumorFactors/Dashboard2
